      <p>Originally from South Carolina, Monica moved to Fernandina Beach, Florida in 2008. It was there she began her career as an educator. It was in 2017 that Monica decided to move to Cary, North Carolina to pursue the opportunity of becoming a school administrator. Throughout the moves and changes she always heard a still, constant voice driving her to the world of tech. She finally decided to answer the calling in November 2020 to embark upon a new career as a full stack web developer.
